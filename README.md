# Visualize Your Data: Generating Datasets with Dissimilar Custom Shapes and Similar Statistical Properties


This repository contains the Projct of Stephan Olbrich and Wael Mohamad Kheshfeh regarding the course Algorithm Engineering WiSe 2021/2022. The structure of the repository is as follows: The folder "project" contains the actual program. Inside of that there are subdirectories in "tools" with which a library is created for the main program "same_stats.cpp" to be used. In the directory "additional_files" .csv and .txt files are located which can be used to work with the program. It is recommended to select this directory as the working directory. The folder "Catch2_Testing_FrameWork" has a similar structure and contains the testing framework to the program. In the main directory you can also find the corresponding paper to our project named "Visualize Your Data.pdf".
