# Generating-2D-Datasets-With-Similar-Statistical-Properties C++_Project for Generating 2D Datasets With Similar Statistical Properties 


Converting the main project /link from main project /a subtask, and how to move to the new way of generation for better visualization methods of data was the biggest part of this project. 

This project allows you to modulate CSv datasets and generate the data based on the mathematical rules defined in the datasets. define a project in text form using YAML files. No one should ever commit an IDE-specific project file to a repository again!
